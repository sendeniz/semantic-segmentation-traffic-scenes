**General:**

This repo contains a comparison between 3 encoder-decoder networks (FCNN, SegNet and UNet) for image segmentation using traffic scenes from the CamVid dataset. The encoder is pre-trained using VGG16 weights. Training and test metrics such as binary cross entropy loss, IoU and pixel accuracy are computed and averaged across an entire epoch.
